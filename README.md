# Introduction 

This project is based on the contents of `Practical Docker with Python` book chapter 3 and its [repository](https://github.com/Apress/practical-docker-with-python/tree/master/source-code).

The Python app is a simple application with a bot interface using Telegram Messenger to fetch the last 10 stories from Reddit. To run the newsbot, start the python script with the command:

    python src/newsbot/newsbot.py

In the Telegram Messenger window of the bot, type a `/start` command, set a source subreddit with the `/source` command (e.g., `/source python`) and tell the bot to fetch some news with `/fetch`.
